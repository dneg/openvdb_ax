/// Based off of the versioning system within openvdb. There is currently no AX
/// namespace versioning which instead leverages openvdb's version namespace.
///
/// The library minor version number gets incremented whenever a change is made
/// to any aspect of the public API (not just the grid API) that necessitates
/// changes to client code.  Changes to APIs in private or internal namespaces
/// do not trigger a minor version number increment; such APIs should not be used
/// in client code.
///
/// A patch version number increment indicates a change, usually a new feature
/// or a bug fix, that does not necessitate changes to client code but rather
/// only recompilation of that code (because the library namespace incorporates
/// the version number).
